I made a memory game with C, but it's a simple one. It creates 10 random numbes between 0 and 9, and displays it. After 10 seconds, clears the screen and displays 10 "*". The user can write what he remembers about the numbers. In the end, the game display the user try and the right list of numbers. I goal to, when I learn it, compare every number and create a display for user's right answers.
