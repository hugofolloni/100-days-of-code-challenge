Yesterday (or today, if you wanna think like that), 3:00 AM, I was playing League with some friends and I had an idea: create a command for the HeyO bot that can display nicely the League's summoner stats, rank, LP and another infos. So, today I made an update to my old ".elo" command. The old one just get the URL for op.gg page, but now, it can create a beautiful label to display everything about the player, besides the op.gg URL. Tomorrow, I want to make this code cleaner, add some functions and correct the Discord message that should display. But, for now, I just started the "NEW '.ELO' COMMAND".
