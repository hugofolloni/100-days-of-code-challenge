Today I updated some small problems on my old To-Do List project. I want to, soon, when I finish my React basic studies, recreate this, with a new code and doing, now, on a good way. Also, I want to follow the [To-Do-App idea](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/2-Intermediate/To-Do-App.md) to guide my project. You can expect good stuff coming out.
