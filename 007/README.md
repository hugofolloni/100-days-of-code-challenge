While I'm studying React, trying to learn things to use on Ganhos Futuros project, I've decided to create simple projects, so I can use the rest of my time studying. So, today I made a silly but "workful for small sizes" algorithm that can solve anagrams. Basically, the user can write a phrase, or a word, and the project will return the first 1.000.000 shuffles of that letters that it finds. It is awful for words with more than 7 chars, and takes a long time to solve them, but, for smallers, takes an  acceptable time to resolve every possible sequence with these chars. So, with easier projects like that, I can spend more time studying React and other stuff.
