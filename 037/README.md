Today I finished the landing page application. It's a simple page that:

    Frontend:
        user inserts his email
        the email is added via POST to an API

    Backend:
        GET data from API
        sents an email for each email there

I'm so proud of myself, because this was my first full-stack project, handling with front and backend.
