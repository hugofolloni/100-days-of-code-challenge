Today I made my first project in React, entirely by myself. For now, I learned how to declare variables using "useState" and, with 'styled-components', set dark/light themes on a very simple app. Now, I plan to create a very simple (for now, it's just what I can do haha) blog, where the users can post or delete their posts. Stay tuned to watch it.
