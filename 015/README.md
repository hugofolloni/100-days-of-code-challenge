Today I created a Blackjack command to HeyO. My goal is to start creating a few games to add to the bot, so the users could enjoy puzzles while in queue or just have fun. After a long time wasted, and after trying a lot of different paths, I could resolve the problem around keeping the array for the users plays and could make this work.
