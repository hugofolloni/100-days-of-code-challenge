Create a Discord bot that finds, by the user's message, the wikipedia page related. And, if the user don't tell me any arguments that I can find a page, just display a random page. I've mixed my new knowledge about crawlers with my discord.js love. And, in the end, I added this command to my main Discord Bot, the HeyO.
