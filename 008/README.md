Today, I tried to create an API to get the promotional free games from Epic Games, Steam, Prime Gaming and etc, but I've decided to let it for another day. So, today I just made a Rock Paper Scissors game, in HTML/CSS/JS. I still learning React, trying to improve my front-end skills and apply them on Ganhos Futuros project.
