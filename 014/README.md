Today I've learned how to create variables inside the same "package". Like, before today, everytime that I wanted to declare a variable, I was doing like:
```
    var currentDate = ...
    var currentTime = ...
    var currentTemperature = ...
```

And now, I learned how to do this:
```
const current = {
    date: ...,
    time: ...,
    temperature: ...,
}
```
It salved me a lot of time and space, and now I can create variable easier than I was thought.

Also, today Riot did give to me my API key, and know I can publish HeyO's ".lol" command.
