Today I added the "last pomodoros" function. With this, the user can access his past timers with the descriptions telling what he did on that time and the task that he spent time working on.

Also, today I started my portfolio page. Since I don't have a large number of projects, it's small and not completed. But it is a start, right? hahaha. By the way, I plan to create the app without use '.css' files. It will be a challenge, seriously haha.
