                <p>My name is Hugo Folloni Guarilha and I'm a 18 years old brazilian developer. I love technologies and development since my childhood, but just in 2017 I started to code. My first apps was in Python, while I was doing high school. After that, I focused on Web development, with JavaScript and HTML/CSS. In July 2021 I started to learn React and I'm currently looking for opportunities in this area.</p>
                <p>I am a self-taught developer, but now I'm a Computer Science student, at UFRJ, one of the most prestigiated universities in Brazil. My perseverance and my ability to learn by myself are maybe the nicest things that I have, and that will keep me focused on grow as a professional and a person.</p>
