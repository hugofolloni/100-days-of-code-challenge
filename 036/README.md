Today I tried to create a landing page for my future portolio website. It's an "under construction" page, that has the email input for, when it's ready, send to all that added emails an alert. Today, I created all frontend stuff and the send-email prototype. Tomorrow, I plan to fix the funcionalities of adding emails to the database and of sending an email for every account on database.
