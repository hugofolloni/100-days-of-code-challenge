Today, I've started the Ganhos Futuros, now with JavaScript. On my early early early days coding, my very first project was a investiment interface, where the user could add a few specifications and it returns the price of the wanted arguments. Now, with a bit more of experience, I'm gonna try to do this with some frameworks, a database and etc, requiring prices from a API. Today was the very beginning of this. It is, for now, a simply HTML page with some infos that I get from an open API. I want to, for the next few days (or weeks hehehe), work on this project to make this real.
